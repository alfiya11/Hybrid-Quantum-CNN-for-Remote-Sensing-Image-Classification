# Hybrid-Quantum-CNN-for-Remote-Sensing-Image-Classification

Image classification is a fundamental task in the field of remote sensing, 
with applications ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning. 
Traditional image classification techniques rely on classical machine learning 
algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs). These methods have achieved significant success in recent 
years, particularly with the advent of deep learning. With increasing volume and 
complexity of remote sensing data, classical computing methods face challenges. 
This is where quantum computing plays vital role. It makes use if qubits instead 
of classical bits, quantum gates and quantum circuits. Circuit-based Hybrid 
Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) serve as an effective tool for 
picture categorization in the field of remote sensing. These hybrid QCNNs 
enhance the design of standard convolutional neural networks by smoothly 
incorporating a quantum layer into their structure. It makes use of different 
quantum mechanics principles to deal with high- dimensional data.
